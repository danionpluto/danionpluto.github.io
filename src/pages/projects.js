Many of those who are affected by the censorship tend to be students who are eager to  access books through public libraries that will educate them about the world around them, as well as give them access to communities that can provide life saving support systems. When searching up discourse ridden queries, it is helpful to know which books have been restricted or taken off shelves in order to amplify them and preserve the knowledge and stories that lie within their covers. At the same time, we want to make the history of where and when books about race, LGBTQ+ rights, and feminism have been banned accessible through an information retrieval system.

The platform is designed to facilitate sustainable consumption by allowing users to swap items they no longer need with others in our Cornell Community. As part of the umbrella Project Team CUSD, I served as the development and team lead of the project and lead the migration over to a website format to make the site more accessible to other students. Although I primarily served as development lead,  worked to facillitate the work of 3 subteams: development, UI/UX, and Marketing to truly synthesize our application as a marketplace application product. \n Our team worked to integrate a Firebase database into a React Native powered IOS app and a React website."
