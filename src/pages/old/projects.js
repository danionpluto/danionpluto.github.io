<h2 className="proj-title">Censored Books</h2>
<div className = "descr">
  
  <h3 className="blurb-proj"> Using Boolean search, Cosine similarity, and SVD, we created an information retrieval system to 
  combat the growing censorship about various topics, many of which affect marginalized communities to a 
  greater degree. Many of those who are affected by the censorship tend to be students who are eager to 
  access books through public libraries that will educate them about the world around them, as well as 
  give them access to communities that can provide life saving support systems. When searching up discourse 
  ridden queries, it is helpful to know which books have been restricted or taken off shelves in order to 
  amplify them and preserve the knowledge and stories that lie within their covers. At the same time, we want 
  to make the history of where and when books about race, LGBTQ+ rights, and feminism have been banned accessible 
  through an information retrieval system.</h3>
