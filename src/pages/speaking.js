Many of those who are affected by the censorship tend to be students who are eager to access books through public libraries that will educate them about the world around them, as well as give them access to communities that can provide life-saving support systems. When searching up discourse-ridden queries, it is helpful to know which books have been restricted or taken off shelves in order to amplify them and preserve the knowledge and stories that lie within their covers. At the same time, we want to make the history of where and when books about race, LGBTQ+ rights, and feminism have been banned accessible through an information retrieval system.",
